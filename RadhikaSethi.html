        I'm a final-year student working at IISER in computational biology. My previous
        experiences include being part of the data science team at a startup, working as a
        research assistant at the University of California, Irvine, to name a few. Here, I'll
        discuss my experiences and how undergraduate students can gain valuable work
        experience in the startup and academic worlds.

        During my second year, I actively sought experience to understand what research
        genuinely meant, especially in the interdisciplinary fields. I also wanted to obtain
        work experience at a company and prepare for programming interviews for summer
        internships.
    </p>
    <p>
        I discovered data science internship opportunities at various Bangalore-based
startups through networking and the guidance of a mentor. I applied to many
well-known startups and applied through a recommendation to one such Ed-Tech
Startup, Shunya. Inc, and received a response from the team within a few weeks. I
completed a take-home assignment and had a phone interview for it. Let's fast
forward to when I joined the team. Shunya was working on developing a
hyper-personalized learning platform. Our team worked on Data Science research for
cognitive analysis, focusing on Item Response Theory, ontology, and knowledge
graphs. We worked on statistical models for calculating maximum likelihood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Networking on Linkedin and Twitter and browsing AngelList, are the most effective
ways to find prospective startups. AngelList is a website that connects tech startups
looking for seed investment with investors. These are early-stage companies that
must develop and market their product in a fast-paced setting. Working for a startup
might benefit you in two ways. The first is that you have more flexibility to build the
product and idea from the bottom up. The second is that you deliver at pace, which
means you must constantly expand your skill sets and develop excellent results while
being mentored. Reaching out to early-stage founders and joining a startup is
significantly easier than going for unicorns, which require a high profile and extensive
work experience. (The premise is that working on a business at an early stage allows
you to learn more). To summarise, working in a startup helps you grow your network
and gain access to new opportunities while constantly honing your technical skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also wanted to look into academic research and what it entails, bearing in mind what
        higher education in the field might involve. I was actively looking for research
        internships and summer/winter programs during my third year. I recall missing the
        Mitacs Internship deadline, which prompted me to take the process seriously and
        explore other options. International students are not eligible for several summer
        research programs offered by universities abroad; instead, I discovered summer
        school programs such as Quantum Computing Summer Schools- QuisKit and a
        summer school at University College London. I was awarded a scholarship to UCL's
        summer school, which piqued my interest in multidisciplinary research in computer
        science and biology. I got to apply computational methods to solve biological
        problems and spent time interacting with Ph.D. students and senior researchers in the
        
        field during summer school. I worked on tractography and neuroimaging. The
        summer school was when I discovered the numerous areas of computer science. I had
        the chance to work with clinicians/medics, computer scientists, mathematicians, and
        medical physicists who work with clinical collaborators. I realized that one doesn't
        need to be from a particular background to contribute to work in the field and that
        people from different backgrounds bring in various perspectives to work on problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        After summer school, I realized my interest in the field and the various domains of
        biology. Genomic mutations (genetics) piqued my interest. On reading papers and
        following up on ongoing research, I reached out to a few professors. In a matter of
        days, I received responses from three professors, and after further discussion, I began
        working as a research assistant in bioinformatics at the University of California,
        Irvine. Because bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field, I used my computational
        skills while also learning about the biology aspect of the problem. In the research
        group, I worked on neural variational inferences on TF networks. I used deep learning
        methods to understand the regulatory interactions between transcription factors and
        their target genes. I had the opportunity to lead an entire research project and
        contribute to another ongoing project at the time. Working at an international lab
        helped me build cross-cultural skills and understand how research labs in the USA
        work. We would have lab meetings twice a week to present our results and discuss
        questions related to the project. One learns teamwork skills and how to operate with
        different time zones, especially if it's remote work.

        My team and I reached out to various professors in June and July this year, as we were
        inclined to work on a thesis as part of our final year project. We put together a list of
        professors in India working in the domain, reached out, and connected with a few. We
        had the opportunity to discuss with them and learn about the ongoing research at
        their labs. After a few discussions, we realized our inclination to pursue our project at
        IISER in the domain of computational biology.
    </p>
    <p>
       I've recently come across quite a few research opportunities in India. Microsoft
Research, TCS Research, and a few labs across India actively look for research interns
or fellows to contribute to their work and be mentored by a research scientist. It can be
tough to get relevant industrial and academic experience as an undergrad student, but
it is achievable. Find programs that accept overseas students or look for opportunities
by attending conferences and networking with the attendees. Reach out to people in
the field via LinkedIn and understand the process they took to reach there. It helps to
understand the skill sets needed to get particular work experience.

The best way to get research opportunities is by discussing with your professors and
asking if they could recommend you to someone in the field. If not, reading papers and
expressing your learnings and suggestions in an email to the professors you want to
work with better demonstrates your interest to work under them rather than a generic
email asking for a research position at their lab. Professors are more likely to reply if
they see the student is interested in their work and has some potential ideas about it.
At college, we also have research internships, initiated by Dr. Sunita Jahirabadkar,
wherein students with similar interests as a professor, are matched to work on a
research project, during summer break. Reach out to the professors you would like 
to work with and learn from, beforehand!


I understand that it's not easy to ﬁnd your niche, but the ﬁrst step is always to identify 
what interests you. Maybe a workshop or a particular subject intrigued you. Identify the 
problems in the domain, potential problems that you would like to work on, and make a list.
Search them up on Google and Google scholar, read papers on it (just the introduction/summary
and the conclusion) and look at where the authors are, where they work, and their domain. 
You might ﬁnd some professors at college interested in the same ﬁelds too, reach out for a 
casual talk and understand their interests and point of view.

Apart from that, corporate experience is necessary as well. Experiencing both helps
to reason your interests and understand your goals. Think of each experience as an investment
of your time and how you can build from those experiences. The most valuable thing I've learned 
throughout is that one needs to ﬁnd good mentors. Your growth is directly proportional 
to the kind of people you work with or who mentor you. Someone willing to spend time on you 
is way more important than chasing top opportunities where someone might not have enough time on 
their hands to take you through the initial work or understandings.



    
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <br>  
Best of luck! Feel free to reach out to me in case of questions, and try to pack in as much experience and explore as many domains as you can during your undergrad!
