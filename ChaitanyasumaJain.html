      <p class="w3-center w3-large"><strong>By Chaitanyasuma Jain</strong></p>

<p>   
    AICVS hosted its Webinar Series AICVS 1.0 with its 5th session on 11th July 2020 on <strong>“Exploring opportunities for undergrads”</strong>. The speaker for the webinar was Chaitanyasuma Jain.
    <br><br>
    Chaitanyasuma is the recipient of the Goldman Sachs WeTech ‘19 scholarship, and Avery Dennison InvEnt 2018 scholarship. She is a former WiDS volunteer and also started and currently runs, our college level coding club called “ Loop” and was the coordinator for a STEM outreach initiative with Teach for India, Pune. She secured an internship at Deutsche Bank and was also selected for the University of Notre Dame research fellowship at Indiana, USA, through college. And due to the pandemic she is currently working with a Bangalore-based start-up. She along with her team, has previously presented their research work at a national-level conference organised by ISRO at SAC, Ahmedabad. She is also an open source contributor and an avid hackathon participant. In this session, she guided us with opportunities that we can grasp as undergrads, from open source and volunteering to projects and internships.
    <br><br>
    The session started with Chaitanyasuma sharing her successes and failures and agenda of the session – <strong>“Understanding and Exploring the opportunities on your own.”</strong> Being a FY or SY student ,we don’t explore many opportunities but it can be done by joining college clubs and participating in the hackathon and doing projects and also the internship programs. She started explaining about organisations and volunteering. She said we should associate with various clubs like IEEE ,AICVS ,Rotaract as these clubs provide us benefits like access to resources ,projects ,programs and conferences ,due to which we are able to explore more and connect with peers and do meaningful work.
    <br><br>
    Chaitanyasuma then put forward the idea of <strong>projects and hackathons</strong>. Hackathons are the best way to learn about innovation, building applications, and working as a team in a high-pressure environment like hackathons have and also understanding business aspects of an idea. She also added some notable contests for working on projects like Avery Dennison Scholarship, DSC solution challenge ,IBM Call for Code etc . where we can compete with people all over the world and put our idea forward.
    <br><br>
    She also explained about Open Source. Open Source is basically a term that is originally referred to open source software (OSS). OSS is a code that is designed to be publicly accessible which can be read, modified and everyone can contribute to it even if you are not a student . She stated some popular Open Source sites like GitHub and Bitbucket. There are several Open Source programs and they follow a common structure which includes
    <ul>
        <li>Community Bonding – interaction with mentors from the organisations as they are in need of the developers who can contribute to that code. So you should understand the code ,know the program in detail and should ask doubts and clear it.</li>
        <li>Applications -Select projects you are interested in. And you need to come up with some ideas for the program and draft the proposal with your idea and send it. And on this basis you are selected to work on the program.</li>
        <li>Coding- here you actually need to code and contribute to their code repositories.</li>
        <li>Review- Final review of your work after which you’ll get stipend and certificates if the work qualifies . She mentioned few Open Source programs like Google Summer of Code,Outreachy, Season of KDE,Foss Asia,Rails Girls Summer of Code and the starting dates and the coding periods of these programs in the slides whose link is below.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <br>
    Moving on to <strong> Internship Programs</strong> ,she explained what can one do as an undergraduate intern. She added one should do 4 things in 4 summers of the engineering namely
    <ol>
    <li>Contributing to Open Source</li>
    <li>Working with a start-up</li>
    <li>Working under a professor and contribute to their research</li>
    <li>Lastly working at a Corporate and gaining industry experience. She mentioned some International Research Programs , research at Indian Institutes and corporate internship opportunities in the slides. Some of these programs are exclusive and people from all over the world applies for it and so you need to make your application very strong in terms of statement of purpose and in terms of research you’ve pursued independently. Cold emailing is emailing the organization directly by visiting the website and finding their faculty associated with computer labs and their researches and specifying your interest in the particular field. She mentioned cold emailing should continue till you the thing you have interest in even if you fail may time. Lastly, she explained about placements. She stated, there are many off-campus placements opportunities too which you should ask about to your seniors as it gives the chance to apply if you have missed one or the other company. You can also get placements through contests like Infosys and also through referrals when you ask someone to refer you to a company and be approached, she added. For the preparation, her advice was competitive coding is must. Also projects and good balance of academic and co-curricular activities also matter.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Chaitanyasuma’s advice:</h3>
    <ul>
       <li> Write impactful emails.</li>
